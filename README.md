# PythonPoker

This code is made by two dumb french guys in high school
This has no purpose other than having fun coding a poker game in Python

/!\ EVERY CHANGELOG IS AND WILL BE ANNOUNCED IN FRENCH /!\

Feel free to do anything you want with this code, it is not meant
to be finished quickly and to be well optimized, it's just for fun.
